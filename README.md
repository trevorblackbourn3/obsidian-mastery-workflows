## 🚀 How to Use

1. Browse to the chapter that matches your workflow
2. Open the template file for that workflow
3. Copy the template you need
4. Paste into your Obsidian vault
5. Fill in your own content

All templates are blank—just the structure with field names. Replace placeholder text with your actual content.
